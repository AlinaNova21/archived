# Steam Minigame Slave Script
Just a simple script I put together to spawn extra game windows to aid in cps since it seems to be a per-client restriction.
With this (And 10 Slaves) I saw my gold multiply itself by roughly 10x when my window synced after boss fights. I say roughly as getting to absolute 0 gold is hard and occasionally slaves lag enough that their cps drops.

Slave count will need to be adjusted depending on your computer. I can run 10 slaves stable. More than that and they all end to start lagging and lose the extra cps.
